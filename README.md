# SQL-plus
This is my first database management learning process

This assignment is to create and simulate a couple month records for an animal shelter called MPH. The whole process is to create business rules and make a ERD diagram of the business rules. After that, use the SQL plus to create the table for all the entities inside the ERD, insert data for each table and make query for creating report for the company for some purpose.
